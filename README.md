# <Horiseon-Info-Website>

## Description

- The motivation for this project was to facilitate the navigation methods present in the webpage, while also sharpening the broad accessibility options available in the source code.
- This project was created so that potential Horiseon clients would have a reliable navigation bar and people who need the various accessibility options would have them.
- My edits to the starter code solved the broken link in the navigation bar and added in detailed comments breaking down each element of the code
- Throughout this project I learned how to troubleshoot non-functional elements of the webpage as well as incorporate the broad accessibility features required by every webpage.
